The Code You Reviewed is Not the Code You Built

Ken Thompson's "Reflections on trusting trust" highlights the potential disparity between source code and the final built product, cautioning developers to question their trust model right down to the compiler itself. 

When you import a third party library, do you review every line of code? Most software packages depend on external libraries, trusting that those packages aren’t doing anything unexpected. If that trust is violated, the consequences can be huge—regardless of whether the package is malicious, or well-intended but using overly broad permissions, such as with Log4j in 2021. 

the BoltDB typosquat

1. The threat actor created a malicious Go package with a name closely resembling the legitimate boltdb/bolt package, choosing boltdb-go/bolt. This subtle naming variation was designed to mislead developers into selecting the malicious package, either through typographical errors or by mistake.
2. The malicious package was published to a public repository, triggering the Go Module Proxy service to fetch and cache the package upon its first request. Once cached, the package became persistently available for subsequent downloads.
3. After ensuring the malicious package was cached by the Go Module Proxy, the threat actor modified the Git tags in the source repository, redirecting them to a benign, legitimate version. This deceptive tactic ensured that a manual inspection of the GitHub repository would not reveal traces of malware, while the Go Module Proxy continued serving the cached malicious version to unsuspecting developers. 
4. Notably, the .info file for the malicious module on the Go Module Mirror lacked the resolved Git commit SHA references that would typically link back to the malicious code in the GitHub repository.
This sequence of actions enabled the threat actor to exploit the Go Module Proxy’s caching mechanism, ensuring that the malicious package remained available to developers, even after the repository’s tags were modified
• This shows a simple review of the GitHub source can give a false sense of safety.
• Lesson: packages you download may not match the source you inspected — trust the build artifact, not just the repo. https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-package-exploits-go-module-proxy-caching-for-persistence

How Capslock helps


Capslock is a capability analysis CLI tool that informs users of privileged operations (like network access and arbitrary code execution) in a given package and its dependencies.

This CLI tool will provide deeper insights into the behavior of dependencies by reporting code paths that access privileged operations in the standard libraries. 

Capabilities vs Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability management is an important part of your supply chain security, but it doesn’t give you a full picture of whether your dependencies are safe to use. Adding capability analysis into your security posture, gives you a better idea of the types of behavior you can expect from your dependencies, identifies potential weak points, and allows you to make a more informed choice about using a given dependency. 


Capslock is motivated by the belief that the principle of least privilege—the idea that access should be limited to the minimal set that is feasible and practical—should be a first-class design concept for secure and usable software. Applied to software development, this means that a package should be allowed access only to the capabilities that it requires as part of its core behaviors. For example, you wouldn’t expect a data analysis package to need access to the network or a logging library to include remote code execution capabilities. 


• Capslock looks at what a package can do, not just what the code looks like.
• It finds calls to powerful operations: network access, running other programs, writing files, low-level syscalls, etc.
• If a package unexpectedly can contact the internet or run commands, Capslock will flag that as suspicious.
• You can run it on the published module and on the GitHub clone to compare what each can do.
• If the published module has extra capabilities that the GitHub code doesn’t, that’s a red flag.
• Use Capslock before adding a dependency and in CI to catch surprises early.

Analysis and Transformation Tools for Go Codebase Modernization - modernizer tool

a discussion of recent tools to "modernize" your codebase so that it uses the most efficient, clear, and idiomatic features of the newest Go releases https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/modernize

• It’s an analyzer that spots places in existing Go code where newer language or standard library features can simplify or clarify the code.
• Each suggestion (diagnostic) comes with a fix you can apply, ideally without changing program behavior. 
• The tool supports a “mass fix” mode (-fix) to apply many suggested modernizations in one go.
• Because some automatic fixes might introduce unused variables or imports, or accidentally drop comments, human review is still recommended before merging.

What sorts of modernizations it suggests (categories)
Here are some of the transformation categories built into modernize: Go Packages
	• forvar: drop unnecessary variable shadowing like x := x that newer loop semantics make redundant
	• slicescontains: replace manual loops checking elem == needle with slices.Contains (Go 1.21+)
	• minmax: convert if … else … to min / max built-ins in simple cases
	• sortslice: replace sort.Slice(...) with slices.Sort(...) when possible
	• efaceany: change uses of interface{} to any where safe (Go 1.18+)
	• mapsloop: simplify map manipulation code by using new maps package functions (e.g. maps.Copy, maps.Insert, maps.Clone)
	• fmtappendf: simplify []byte(fmt.Sprintf(...)) patterns using fmt.Appendf
	• testingcontext: in tests, prefer t.Context() over context.WithCancel usage in newer Go versions
	• omitzero: prefer omitempty vs older zero-value struct tags features (for Go 1.24+)
	• bloop: for benchmarks, replace manual loop constructions with b.Loop() in Go 1.25+
	• rangeint: simplify classic for i := 0; i < n; i++ loops to for i := range … where feasible
	• stringsseq, stringscutprefix: replace older Split/HasPrefix/TrimPrefix combos with new SplitSeq, CutPrefix, etc.
	• waitgroup: simplify sync.WaitGroup usage via WaitGroup.Go in newer Go versions

Scaling LLMs with Go: Production Patterns for Handling Millions of AI Requests

• Why Go for LLM infra: While most LLM stacks are Python-first, Assembled found Go’s type system, concurrency, and interfaces much better for production-scale reliability. assembled.com
• Type safety: Go’s structs and reflection make handling structured LLM outputs (e.g. JSON schemas) simple and safe, removing the need for separate schema definitions. assembled.com
• Concurrency & latency: Goroutines and channels enable easy parallelization in RAG pipelines (e.g. querying multiple search backends at once), reducing total latency to the slowest backend instead of adding them up. assembled.com
• Composable pipelines: Interfaces make it easy to build modular response processing pipelines (e.g. cleaning, structuring, adding citations). Each step is testable and maintainable. assembled.com
• Python still matters: Used for ML-heavy tasks like clustering, embeddings, and fine-tuning with mature libraries. Go handles production infra, while Python powers prototyping and compute-heavy ML. assembled.com
• Hybrid approach: Python services handle experimentation; Go ports performance-critical parts to production once proven. assembled.com
• Key takeaway: Go gives strong type safety, concurrency, and composability for production-scale LLM systems, while Python complements with experimentation and ML tooling. 




Model Context Protocol (MCP) & Go SDK
	• What is MCP:
		○ An open standard for connecting LLMs to external tools, APIs, and data sources.
		○ Lets AI assistants or IDE plugins interact with systems using natural language.
	• What it’s used for:
		○ Exposes application functionality as “tools” or “resources” for LLMs.
		○ Enables AI-driven workflows directly inside IDEs or apps.
	• Go SDK support (github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk):
		○ Provides Go developers an idiomatic way to build MCP servers and clients.
		○ Handles tool registration, session management, JSON-RPC transport, and schema validation.
	• How to use it:
		○ Wrap your Go app’s functionality with MCP server handlers.
		○ Expose selected APIs or workflows to MCP clients safely.
		○ AI assistants or IDE plugins can now call your Go app via natural language requests.
	• Go-specific advantages:
		○ Strong type safety ensures robust request/response handling.
		○ Concurrency (goroutines, channels) allows scalable handling of multiple AI requests.
		○ Interfaces enable modular, composable MCP server design.
		○ Overall: build reliable, maintainable, high-performance MCP servers in Go.

The Go race detector works by instrumenting your code at build time when you pass -race. It tracks memory accesses and synchronization events at runtime, using happens-before analysis to detect unsynchronized conflicting accesses. It’s slow and memory-hungry, but invaluable for catching subtle concurrency bugs during development and testing.


Execution tracing is about recording what your Go program is doing at runtime—which goroutines are created, when they run, when they block/unblock, how they interact with channels, and what syscalls or network events occur.
It’s different from profiling (which focuses on CPU/memory usage). Tracing gives you a timeline of events that helps answer questions like:
	• Why is my program slow even though CPU isn’t maxed out?
	• Are goroutines spending too much time waiting on locks or channels?
	• Is there unexpected contention in scheduling?
Go comes with a built-in tracing tool in the standard library (runtime/trace) and CLI support via go tool trace.


Go Tool Trace — Overview & Usage
	• Purpose:
		○ go tool trace is used to analyze runtime execution of Go programs.
		○ Helps understand goroutine scheduling, blocking, and latency issues in concurrent programs.
	• How it works:
		○ Run your program with tracing enabled:

go test -trace trace.out

or

go run -trace trace.out main.go
		○ Open the trace in a web browser:

go tool trace trace.out
	• What you can inspect:
		○ Goroutine activity: creation, blocking, and scheduling.
		○ Network & syscall events to see I/O bottlenecks.
		○ Scheduler latency: identify when goroutines are waiting to run.
		○ Heap profile and GC pauses (via integrated links in the trace).
	• Benefits:
		○ Pinpoints race conditions or deadlocks in concurrent Go programs.
		○ Helps optimize parallel workloads by visualizing real runtime behavior.
		○ Provides a timeline view of program execution for debugging performance issues.
	• Relation to race detection:
		○ While the race detector finds data races at runtime, Go tool trace shows the actual scheduling and blocking patterns, giving a deeper understanding of concurrency behavior.
	• Practical workflow (from our discussion):
		1. Run the Go program or test with -trace.
		2. Open the trace.out file with go tool trace.
		3. Explore visualizations: goroutines, network calls, blocking events, and scheduler delays.
		4. Use insights to optimize concurrency and fix subtle scheduling or latency issues.
